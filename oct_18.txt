Important keywords mentioned in today's lecture

1. Boltzmaan Probability distribution.
2. Second law of thermodynamics.
3. Maxwell-Boltzmaan distribution.
4. Flux density.
5. Charge density.

My understanding of these keywords is:

1. Boltzmaan Probability distribution:-
    -The Boltzmann distribution (kinetic energy distribution) is a distribution that describes the amount of kinetic energy that a proportion of gas particles have in a given sample.
    -It gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state's energy.

2. Second law of thermodynamics:-
    -The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system (the thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work) can never decrease.
    -It talks about entropy.
    -Energy is not created nor destroyed, but it can change from one energy form to another.

3. Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann distribution:-
    - Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution is a probability distribution used for describing the speeds of various particles within a stationary container at a specific temperature.
    - The distribution is often represented with a graph, with the y-axis defined as the number of molecules and the x-axis defined as the speed.
    - In short, the graph shows the number of molecules per unit speed.
    - The total area underneath the distribution curve equates to the total number of molecules in the gas.

4. Flux density:-
    -The number of lines of force passing through a unit area of material.
    -Magnetic flux density is defined as the amount of magnetic flux in an area taken perpendicular to the magnetic flux's direction.

5. Charge density:-
    -The charge density is the measure for the accumulation of electric charge in a given particular field.
    -The charge density describes how much the electric charge is accumulated in a particular field. Mainly, it finds the charge density per unit volume, surface area, and length.
    -It measures the amount of electric charge as per the following dimensions:
        i.   Per unit length
        ii.  Per unit surface area
        iii. Per unit volume
