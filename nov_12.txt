1.X-rays
2.Compton effect 
3.De Broglie's hypothesis 
4.Schrodinger wave equation
5.uncertainty principle

My understanding of these keywords is:

1.X-rays
    - X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, similar to visible light. 
    - Unlike light, however, x-rays have higher energy and can pass through most objects, including the body.
    - Wavelengths ranging from about 10−8 to 10−12 metre and corresponding frequencies from about 1016 to 1020 hertz (Hz).

2.Compton effect 
    - Compton scattering is an example of inelastic scattering of light by a free charged particle, where the wavelength of the scattered light is different from that of the incident radiation.
    - The effect is significant because it demonstrates that light cannot be explained purely as a wave phenomenon.
    - The amount by which the light's wavelength changes is called the Compton shift.
    - Arthur Compton studied this effect in the year 1922. During the study, Compton found that wavelength is not dependent on the intensity of incident radiation.
3.De Broglie's hypothesis 
    -  The De Broglie hypothesis proposes that all matter exhibits wave-like properties and relates the observed wavelength of matter to its momentum.
    - After Albert Einstein's photon theory became accepted, the question became whether this was true only for light or whether material objects also exhibited wave-like behavior.
    - Lambda = h / p  , where h = planck's constant
4.Schrodinger wave equation
    - The Schrödinger equation is a linear partial differential equation that governs the wave function of a quantum-mechanical system.
    - H * (Si) = E * (Si)
    where 
        - H = hamultonian operator
        - E = energy
        - Si = Wave function
    - The wave function is referred to as the free wave function as it represents a particle experiencing zero net force.
5.uncertainty principle
    - Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the position and the velocity of an object cannot both be measured exactly, at the same time.
    - that is (change in position) * (change in momentum) >= h / ( 4* pie )
    - Any attempt to measure precisely the velocity of a subatomic particle, such as an electron, will knock it about in an unpredictable way, so that a simultaneous measurement of its position has no validity. This result has nothing to do with inadequacies in the measuring instruments, the technique, or the observer; it arises out of the intimate connection in nature between particles and waves in the realm of subatomic dimensions.
