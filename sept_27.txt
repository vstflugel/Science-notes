Important keywords mentioned in today's lecture and my understandings are:

non-dimensionalization of equation.
    Nondimensionalization is the partial or full removal of physical dimensions from an equation involving physical quantities by a suitable substitution of variables. ... For example, if a system has an intrinsic resonance frequency, length, or time constant, nondimensionalization can recover these values.
    They are often derived by combining coefficients from differential equations and are oftentimes a ratio between two physical quantities. The dimensionless numbers can be related to other dimensionless variables or quantities through empirical relations.

Simple harmonic oscillator 
    Lissajous curve is seen when there is force in the two directions, ie when there are restoring forces in both the x and y coordinates.

Phase plot 
    A phase-space plot is a parametric graph of the velocity v(t) plotted as a function of the displacement x(t), with the changing variable being time. Phase-space plots are very useful for analyzing more complicated oscillations, especially oscillation that tends towards chaos.
    The motion represented by the simple harmonic oscillator is termed as free oscillation.

Damped oscillations.
    it is frequently assumed that the damping force is a linear function of the velocity.
    Here Beta is the damping parameter.
    Then there comes:-
         underdamped motion
         Critically Damped motion
         Overdamped motion

Force is obtained as the derivative of potential energy.
Multiple potential energy minima.
