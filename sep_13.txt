Important keywords mentioned in today's lecture are:
1. Quantization of light
2. KE and Momentum in relativity
3. Relative simutaneity


My understanding of these keywords is:

    1. Quantization of light
        -Einstein proposed that light contains both nature i.e. it acts both like a wave and a particle. and similar behaviour is seen by matter.
        -The light is quantized into discrete levels.
        -Einstein proposed that light contains energy in the form of small packets which he called quanta to explain the photo-electric behaviour. 
        - The energy is given by h*c/wavelength of light.

    2. KE and Momentum in relativity
        -In classical mechanics linear momentum p = mv is a useful quantity because it is conserved in a system of particles not acted upon by outside forces.
        - Momentum is the velocity of the particle. p = γmu
        - γ is the relativistic constant.
        - γ = 1/√1−(u/c)2


    3. Relative simutaneity
        -The loss of simultaneity in Special relativity - is that real or created due to the fact that light take time to travel. So even though 2 events are simultaneous but since light takes time to travel, they may not be simultaneous for two different people. 
        - Given by Einstein, Lorentz, Newton, Maxwell, and others.
